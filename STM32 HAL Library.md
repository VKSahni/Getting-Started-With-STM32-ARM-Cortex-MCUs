# STM32 HAL Library
STMCube® is STMicroelectronics’s original initiative to ease and accelerate the development cycle of embedded products. STM32Cube covers the STM32 portfolio of microcontrollers.
It provides the developer with all the low-level drivers, APIs, and enables him/her to dedicate most of the effort to develop the application layer and any required middleware.
# STM32 HAL Library Drivers
The STM32CubeMX, a graphical software configuration tool that allows generating C initialization code using graphical wizards.

The STM32Cube Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), an STM32 abstraction layer embedded software ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 microcontroller. The HAL is available for all the hardware peripherals.

The low-layer APIs (LL) offering a fast light-weight expert-oriented layer that is closer to the hardware than the HAL. The LL APIs are available only for a set of peripherals.

The HAL and LL are complementary and cover a wide range of applications requirements:

The HAL offers high-level and feature-oriented APIs, with a high-portability level. They hide the MCU and peripheral complexity to end-user.
The LL offers low-level APIs at registers level, with better optimization but less portability. They require deep knowledge of the MCU and peripherals specifications.
The source code of HAL and LL drivers is developed in Strict ANSI-C which makes it independent from the development tools. It is fully documented and is MISRA-C 2004 compliant.
